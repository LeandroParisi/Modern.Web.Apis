  <h1>Modern Web APIs</h1>
  <p>This project is an examples gallery showing the usage of some modern Browser APIs. Feel free to play around and apply
    them to your projects.
    <br><br>
    ‚ö†Ô∏è &nbsp; The browser support is displayed at the bottom of each API page.
    Keep in mind that, being some APIs still in an experimental phase, you might need to use Chrome as browser and to enable
    some
    <cite>Chrome-flags</cite> to test them properly. In each API description is reported all what you need for
    testing.

    üî• Thanks to PWA features, you can also install this web app on your device üî•
    <br><br>
    On <strong>desktop machines</strong> you can install the app locally by clicking in the <i>install</i> icon in the
    browser address bar
    (the image below shows the icon in Chrome):

      On <strong>mobile devices</strong> an "Add-To-Home-Screen" dialog (A2HS)should automatically appear to add the app
      to your
      device
      home screen.

      For each API, I am planning to create an <a href="https://dev.to/paco_ita" class="link" target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> describing in detail how to use it and its
      typical use cases. The project is still evolving and I am planning to add further APIs in the future.
