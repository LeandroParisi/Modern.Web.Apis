# modern-web

This project is an examples gallery showing the usage of some modern browser APIs. 

## Demo

You can test the different APIs at: https://pacoita.github.io/modern-web/home

⚠️ &nbsp; The browser support is displayed at the bottom of each API page. 
Keep in mind that, being some APIs still in an experimental phase, you might need Chrome and to enable some `Chrome-flags` to test them properly. In each API description is reported all what you need to enable for testing.

## PWA Capabilities

The application is a Progressive Web App (PWA), installable on your device. 

On **desktop machines** you can install the app locally by clicking in the *install* icon in the browser address bar (the image below shows the icon in Chrome):

</p> 

Accessing the app with a **mobile device**, you should be automatically prompted to add the application to your device home screen.

If you are interested in [learning more about PWAs](https://dev.to/paco_ita/a-gentle-introduction-to-progressive-web-apps-step-1-24da), have a look at the articles collection I wrote about this topic on the Dev.to portal.

## What's coming next...

For each API, I am goign to create some articles describing in detail how to use it and its typical use cases.
The project is still evolving and I am planning to add further APIs in the future. 

If you are interested in knowing about the project status or when a new article has been published, follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/paco_ITA) where I will post any update.
